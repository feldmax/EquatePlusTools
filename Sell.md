| **1** | **A** | \# Data Query: Retrieves the **Purchase Date (A)**, **Strike Price (€) (G)**, and **Available Quantity (M)** for all portfolio entries that are classified as 'shares'. The results are sorted by date.<br>`=QUERY(Portfolio,"select A,G,M where (C = 'shares') order by A")` |
| **1** | **B** | \# Header: Header for the 'Strike price / Cost basis' column (Value is the retrieved Strike Price from the QUERY in column A).<br>`Strike price / Cost basis` |
| **1** | **C** | \# Header: Header for the 'Available quantity' column (Value is the retrieved Available Quantity from the QUERY in column A).<br>`Available quantity` |
| **1** | **D** | \# Cumulative Available Shares: Calculates the running total (cumulative sum) of available shares in column C.<br>`={"SUM of shares"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(ISBLANK($C2:$C), """", SUMIF(ROW($C$2:$C), "<="&ROW($C2:$C), $C$2:$C) ))}` |
| **1** | **E** | \# Shares to Sell (FIFO Logic): Calculates how many shares from the current lot (C) will be sold based on the total desired sale amount (`Status!$E$35`), applying the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method.<br>`={"Sell shares"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(ISBLANK($C2:$C), """", IF(SUMIF(ROW($C$2:$C), "<="&ROW($C2:$C), $C$2:$C) <= Status!$E$35, $C2:$C, IF(SUMIF(ROW($C$2:$C), "<"&ROW($C2:$C), $C$2:$C) >= Status!$E$35, "", Status!$E$35 - SUMIF(ROW($C$2:$C), "<"&ROW($C2:$C), $C$2:$C) ) ) ))}` |
| **1** | **H** | \# Exchange Rate (Purchase Day): Fetches the NIS/EUR exchange rate on the purchase date (A) for each lot using GOOGLEFINANCE.<br>`={"Exchange rate (purchase day)"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), """", MAP($A2:$A, LAMBDA(date, INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:EURILS" ,"price",date),2,2) )) )}` |
| **1** | **I** | \# Exchange Rate (Target): Retrieves the user-defined expected exchange rate (NIS/EUR) from a reference cell on the 'Status' sheet (`Status!$E$29`).<br>`={"Exchange rate (target rate)"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), "", Status!$E$29))}` |
| **1** | **J** | \# Share Price (Target): Retrieves the user-defined expected share price (€) for the sale from a reference cell on the 'Status' sheet (`Status!$E$28`).<br>`={"Share price (target price)"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), "", Status!$E$28))}` |
| **1** | **K** | \# Allocated Euro (Purchase Day): Calculates the original cost in Euros for the shares sold from this lot: Strike Price (€) (B) * Sell Shares (F).<br>`={"Allocated Euro (purchase day)"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), "", $B2:$B*$F2:$F))}` |
| **1** | **L** | \# Allocated NIS (Purchase Day): Calculates the original cost in Shekels (NIS) for the shares sold using the exchange rate on the purchase day (K * H). This is the basis for tax calculation.<br>`={"Allocated NIS (purchase day)"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), "", $B2:$B*$F2:$F*$H2:$H))}` |
| **1** | **M** | \# Allocated NIS (Target Rate): Calculates the original cost in Shekels (NIS) for the shares sold using the target exchange rate (K * I). Used for tracking purposes.<br>`={"Allocated NIS (target rate)"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), "", $B2:$B*$F2:$F*$I2:$I))}` |
| **1** | **N** | \# Target Sale Value Euro: Calculates the gross sales proceeds in Euros: Shares to Sell (F) * Target Share Price (€) (J).<br>`={"Target Sale Value Euro"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), "", $F2:$F*$J2:$J ))}` |

| **1** | **P** | \# Profit Nominal (Purchase Day Rate): Calculates the nominal profit based on the purchase day exchange rate: Target Sale Value NIS (O) - Allocated NIS (Purchase Day) (L).

| **1** | **R** | \# Profit Nominal for Tax (Min/Max based on Sign): Determines the final nominal profit for tax purposes (R), comparing the two nominal profits (P and Q) based on their signs. If both signs are the same, it takes the smaller absolute value for gain or the larger absolute value for loss. If signs differ, profit is considered 0.<br>`={"Profit nominal for tax"; ARRAYFORMULA(IF(($A2:$A="")+($F2:$F=""), """", IF(SIGN($P2:$P)=SIGN($Q2:$Q), IF($P2:$P>=0, IF($P2:$P<$Q2:$Q, $P2:$P, $Q2:$Q), IF($P2:$P>$Q2:$Q, $P2:$P, $Q2:$Q) ), 0 ) ))}` |
